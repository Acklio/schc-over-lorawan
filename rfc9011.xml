    <abstract>
      <t>The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) specification (RFC 8724) describes
      generic header compression and fragmentation techniques for Low-Power
      Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies. SCHC is a generic mechanism
      designed for great flexibility so that it can be adapted for any of the
      LPWAN technologies.</t>

      <t>The SCHC specification <xref target="RFC8724" format="default"/> describes
generic header compression and fragmentation techniques that can be used on all
Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies defined in
<xref target="RFC8376" format="default"/>. Even though those technologies share a great
number of common features like star-oriented topologies, network architecture,
devices with communications that are mostly quite predictable, etc., they do have some
slight differences with respect to payload sizes, reactiveness, etc.</t>
      <t>SCHC provides a generic framework that enables those devices to communicate on
IP networks. However, for efficient performance, some parameters
and modes of operation need to be set appropriately for each of the LPWAN
technologies.</t>

      SCHC is used over LoRaWAN networks. The LoRaWAN protocol is specified by

      <t><xref target="Fig-archi" format="default"/> represents the
      architecture for compression/decompression; it is based on the terminology from <xref
      target="RFC8376" format="default"/>. The device is sending
      application flows using IPv6 or IPv6/UDP protocols. These flows might
      be compressed by an SCHC C/D to reduce header size, and fragmented
      by the SCHC F/R.  The resulting
      information is sent on a Layer 2 (L2) frame to an LPWAN Radio Gateway
      (RGW) that forwards the frame to a Network Gateway (NGW). The NGW sends
      the data to an SCHC F/R for reassembly, if required, then to an SCHC C/D for
      decompression. The SCHC C/D shares the same rules with the device. The
      SCHC C/D and SCHC F/R can be located on the NGW or in
      another place as long as a communication is established between the NGW
      and the SCHC F/R, then SCHC F/R and SCHC C/D. The SCHC C/D and SCHC F/R in the
      device and the SCHC gateway <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> share the same set of
      rules. After decompression, the packet can be sent on the Internet to
      one or several LPWAN Application Servers (App).</t>
      <t>The SCHC C/D and SCHC F/R process is bidirectional, so the same principles
      can be applied to the other direction.</t>
      <t>In a LoRaWAN network, the RGW is called a "Gateway", the NGW is a
      "Network Server", and the SCHC C/D and SCHC F/R are one or more
      "Application Server". Application servers can be provided by the NGW or any third-party
      software. <xref target="Fig-archi" format="default"/> can be mapped in
      LoRaWAN terminology to:</t>

<dl>

<dt>Class A:
</dt>
<dd>Class A is the simplest class of devices. The device is allowed to
transmit at any time, randomly selecting a communication channel.  The Network
Gateway may reply with a downlink in one of the two receive windows immediately
following the uplinks. Therefore, the Network Gateway cannot initiate a
downlink; it has to wait for the next uplink from the device to get a downlink
opportunity. Class A is the lowest power consumption class.
</dd>

<dt>Class B:
</dt>
<dd>Class B devices implement all the functionalities of Class A devices but
also schedule periodic listen windows. Therefore, as opposed to Class A
devices, Class B devices can receive downlinks that are initiated by the
Network Gateway and not following an uplink. There is a trade-off between the
periodicity of those scheduled Class B listen windows and the power
consumption of the device: if the periodicity is high, downlinks from the NGW
will be sent faster, but the device wakes up more often. Therefore, it will
have higher power consumption.
</dd>
<ul>

  Proposition:
   There is a trade-off between the periodicity of those scheduled Class
   B listen windows and the power consumption of the device:
   - High periodicity: downlinks from the NGW will be sent faster but the
     device wakes up more often and power consumption is increased.
   - Low periodicity: higher latency but lower power consumption.

<dt>Class C:
</dt>
<dd>Class C devices implement all the functionalities of Class A devices but
keep their receiver open whenever they are not transmitting.  Class C devices
can receive downlinks at any time at the expense of a higher power
consumption. Battery-powered devices can only operate in Class C for a limited
amount of time (for example, for a firmware upgrade over-the-air).  Most of the
Class C devices are grid powered (for example, Smart Plugs).

        <t>LoRaWAN end devices use a 32-bit network address (devAddr) to
        communicate with the Network Gateway over the air; this address might
        not be unique in a LoRaWAN network. Devices using the same devAddr are
        distinguished by the Network Gateway based on the cryptographic
        signature appended to every LoRaWAN frame.</t>
        <t>To communicate with the SCHC gateway, the Network Gateway
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> identify the devices by a unique 64-bit device
        identifier called the "DevEUI".</t>
        <t>The DevEUI is assigned to the device during the manufacturing
        process by the device's manufacturer. It is built like an Ethernet MAC
        address by concatenating the manufacturer's IEEE OUI field with a
        vendor unique number.  For example, a 24-bit OUI is concatenated with a 40-bit
        serial number.  The Network Gateway translates the devAddr into a
        DevEUI in the uplink direction and reciprocally on the downlink
        direction.</t>

Author (OGZ)
    Thanks. It is now "Ftype" instead of "MType". Chapter 4.2.1, table 4
    Searching for characters "0b100" does not work as it is written "100"
    in [LORA-SPEC]. Nevertheless, I would like to explain that we are
    using binary base to write this.

	LoRaWAN supports up to 223 application FPorts in
        the range [1;223] as defined in Section 4.3.2 of <xref

        <t>The FPortUp value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be different from FPortDown.  The

        between uplink and downlink sessions.  A RuleID not in the set(s) of

        <t>The only uplink frames using the FPortDown port are the

        devices for the LoRaWAN protocol.</t>

	
        <t>As AppSKey is renewed each time a device joins or rejoins a LoRaWAN
        network, the IID will change over time; this
        mitigates privacy, location tracking, and correlation over time
        risks. Join periodicity is defined at the application level.</t>
        <t>Address-scan risk is mitigated thanks to AES-128, which provides
        enough entropy bits of the IID.</t>
        <t>Using this algorithm will also ensure that there is no correlation
        between the hardware identifier (IEEE-64 DevEUI) and the IID, so an
        attacker cannot use the manufacturer OUI to target devices.</t>

              application specific and will be used by the NGW to transmit a
              potential SCHC ACK REQ.  SCHC_ACK_REQ_DN_OPPORTUNITY is
              application specific and its recommended value is 2. It
              <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be greater than 1. This allows the opening of a

              the SCHC ACK REQ message.</t>
<aside>        <t>Note: The device <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> keep this SCHC
              ACK message in memory until it receives a downlink SCHC
