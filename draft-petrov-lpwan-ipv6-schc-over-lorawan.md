--- abstract

The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) specification describes generic
header compression and fragmentation techniques for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area
Networks) technologies. SCHC is a generic mechanism designed for great
flexibility, so that it can be adapted for any of the LPWAN technologies.

This document provides the adaptation of SCHC for use in LoRaWAN networks, and
provides elements such as efficient parameterization and modes of operation.

# Introduction {#Introduction}

The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) specification
{{I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc}} describes
generic header compression and fragmentation techniques that can be used on all
LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Networks) technologies defined in
{{I-D.ietf-lpwan-overview}}. Even though those technologies share a great
number of common features like start-oriented topologies, network architecture,
devices with mostly quite predictable communications, etc; they do have some
slight differences in respect of payload sizes, reactiveness, etc.

SCHC gives a generic framework that enables those devices to communicate with
other Internet networks. However, for efficient performance, some parameters
and modes of operation need to be set appropriately for each of the LPWAN
technologies.

This document describes the efficient parameters and modes of operation when
SCHC is used over LoRaWAN networks.

# Terminology

This section defines the terminology and acronyms used in this document. For
all other definitions, please look up the SCHC specification
{{I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc}}.

  o  DevEUI: an IEEE EUI-64 identifier used to identify the device during the
     procedure while joining the network (Join Procedure)

  o  DevAddr: a 32-bit non-unique identifier assigned to a device statically or
     dynamically after a Join Procedure (depending on the activation mode)

  o  TBD: all significant LoRaWAN-related terms.

# Static Context Header Compression Overview

This section contains a short overview of Static Context Header Compression
(SCHC). For a detailed description, refer to the full specification
{{I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc}}.

Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) avoids context synchronization, which
is the most bandwidth-consuming operation in other header compression
mechanisms such as RoHC {{RFC5795}}. Based on the fact that the nature of data
flows is highly predictable in LPWAN networks, some static contexts may be
stored on the Device (Dev). The contexts must be stored in both ends, and it
can either be learned by a provisioning protocol or by out of band means or it
can be pre-provisioned, etc. The way the context is learned on both sides is
out of the scope of this document.

{: #Fig-archi title='Architecture'}

{{Fig-archi}} represents the architecture for compression/decompression, it is
based on {{I-D.ietf-lpwan-overview}} terminology. The Device is sending
applications flows using IPv6 or IPv6/UDP protocols. These flows are compressed
by an Static Context Header Compression Compressor/Decompressor (SCHC C/D) to
reduce headers size. Resulting information is sent on a layer two (L2) frame to
a LPWAN Radio Network (RG) which forwards the frame to a Network Gateway (NGW).
The NGW sends the data to a SCHC C/D for decompression which shares the same
rules with the Dev. The SCHC C/D can be located on the Network Gateway (NGW) or
in another place as long as a tunnel is established between the NGW and the
SCHC C/D. The SCHC C/D in both sides must share the same set of Rules. After
decompression, the packet can be sent on the Internet to one or several LPWAN
Application Servers (App).

The SCHC C/D process is bidirectional, so the same principles can be applied in
the other direction.

In a LoRaWAN network, the RG is called a Gateway, the NGW is Network Server,
and the SCHC C/D can be embedded in different places, for example in the
Network Server and/or the Application Server.

Next steps for this section: detailed overview of the LoRaWAN architecture and
its mapping to the SCHC architecture.

#LoRaWAN Architecture

An overview of LoRaWAN {{lora-alliance-spec}} protocol and architecture is
described in {{I-D.ietf-lpwan-overview}}. Mapping between the LPWAN
architecture entities as described in {{I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc}}
and the ones in {{lora-alliance-spec}} is as follows:

   o Devices (Dev) are the end-devices or hosts (e.g. sensors,
   actuators, etc.).  There can be a very high density of devices per
   radio gateway. This entity maps to the LoRaWAN End-device.

   o The Radio Gateway (RGW), which is the end point of the constrained
   link. This entity maps to the LoRaWAN Gateway.

   o The Network Gateway (NGW) is the interconnection node between the
   Radio Gateway and the Internet. This entity maps to the LoRaWAN Network
   Server.

   o LPWAN-AAA Server, which controls the user authentication and the
   applications. This entity maps to the LoRaWAN Join Server.

   o Application Server (App). The same terminology is used in LoRaWAN.

{: #Fig-LPWANarchi title='LPWAN Architecture'}

   SCHC C/D (Compressor/Decompressor) and SCHC Fragmentation are performed on
   the LoRaWAN End-device and the Application Server. While the point-to-point
   link between the End-device and the Application Server constitutes single IP
   hop, the ultimate end-point of the IP communication may be an Internet node
   beyond the Application Server. In other words, the LoRaWAN Application
   Server acts as the first hop IP router for the End-device. Note that the
   Application Server and Network Server may be co-located, which effectively
   turns the Network/Application Server into the first hop IP router.


## Device classes (A, B, C) and interactions

The LoRaWAN MAC layer supports 3 classes of devices named A,B and C.
All devices implement the classA, some devices implement classA+B or class
A+C. ClassB and classC are mutually exclusive.

* *ClassA*: The classA is the simplest class of devices. The device is allowed
  to transmit at any time, randomly selecting a communication channel. The
  network may reply with a downlink in one of the 2 receive windows immediately
  following the uplinks. Therefore, the network cannot initiate a downlink, it
  has to wait for the next uplink from the device to get a downlink
  opportunity. The classA is the lowest power device class.
* *ClassB*: classB devices implement all the functionalities of classA devices,
  but also schedule periodic listen windows. Therefore, as opposed the classA
  devices, classB devices can receive downlink that are initiated by the
  network and not following an uplink. There is a trade-off between the
  periodicity of those scheduled classB listen windows and the power
  consumption of the device. The lower the downlink latency, the higher the
  power consumption.
* *ClassC*: classC devices implement all the functionalities of classA devices,
  but keep their receiver open whenever they are not transmitting. ClassC
  devices can receive downlinks at any time at the expense of a higher power
  consumption. Battery powered devices can only operate in classC for a limited
  amount of time (for example for a firmware upgrade over the air). Most of the
  classC devices are main powered (for example Smart Plugs).

## Device addressing

LoRaWAN devices use a 32bits network address (devAddr) to communicate with
the network over the air. However that address might be reused several time
on the same network. Devices using the same devAddr are separated by the
network server based on the cryptographic signature appended to every single
LoRaWAN MAC frame, as all devices use different security keys.
To communicate with the SCHC gateway the network server MUST identify the
devices by a unique 64bits device ID called the devEUI. Unlike devAddr,
devEUI is guaranteed to be unique for every single device across all
networks. The devEUI is assigned to the device during the manufacturing
process by the device‚Äôs manufacturer. The devEUI is built like an Ethernet
MAC address by concatenating the manufacturer‚Äôs IEEE 24bits OUI field with a
40bits serial number.
The network server translates the devAddr into a devEUI in the uplink
direction and reciprocally on the downlink direction.

## General Message Types

## LoRaWAN MAC Frames

# SCHC over LoRaWAN

## Rule ID management

The LoRaWAN MAC layers features a port field in all frames. This port field
(FPort) is 8bit long and the values from 1 to 220 can be used.
SCHC over LoRaWAN uses 2 contiguous FPort value to separate the uplink SCHC
traffic from the downlink and avoid any confusion. Those FPorts are called
FPortUp and FPortDwn. Those FPorts can use arbitrary values inside the allowed
Fport range but must be shared by the end-device and SCHC gateway.

SCHC over LoRAWAN encodes RuleID on 3 bits, there are therefore 8 possible
RuleIds on both uplink and downlink direction.

The RuleID 0 is reserved for fragmentation in both directions. The 7
remaining RuleIDs are available for IPV6 header compression. Uplink (on
FPortUp) and downlink (on FportDwn) RuleIDs are independent. The same RuleID
may have different meanings on the uplink and downlink paths.

The only uplink messages using the FportDwn port are the fragmentation SCHC
ACKs messages of a downlink fragmentation session. Similarly, the only
downlink messages using the FportUp port are the fragmentation SCHC ACKs
messages of an uplink fragmentation session

## IID computation
TBD

## Fragmentation {#Frag}

The L2 word size used by LoRaWAN is 1 octet (8 bits).
The SCHC fragmentation over LoRaWAN exclusively uses the ACK-always mode.
A LoRaWAN device cannot support simultaneous interleaved fragmentation
sessions in the same direction (uplink or downlink). This means that only a
single fragmented IPV6 datagram may be transmitted and/or received by the
device at a given moment.
The fragmentation parameters are different for uplink and downlink
fragmentation sessions and are successively described in the next sections.

### Uplink fragmentation: From device to gateway

In that case the device is the fragmentation transmitter, and the SCHC gateway
the fragmentation receiver.

* SCHC fragmentation reliability mode : `ACK_ALWAYS`
* Window size: 8, the FCN field is encoded on 3 bits
* DTag : 1bit. this field is used to clearly separate two consecutive
  fragmentation sessions. A LoRaWAN device cannot interleave several fragmented
  SCHC datagrams.
* MIC calculation algorithm: CRC32 using 0xEDB88320 (i.e. the reverse
  representation of the polynomial used e.g. in the Ethernet standard
  [RFC3385])
* Retransmission Timer and inactivity Timer:
  LoRaWAN devices do not implement a "retransmission timer". At the end of a
  window the ACK corresponding to this window is transmitted by the network
  gateway in the RX1 or RX2 receive slot of the device. If this ACK is not
  received the device sends an all-0 (or an all-1) fragment with no payload to
  request an ACK retransmission. The periodicity between retransmission of the
  all-0/all-1 fragments is device/application specific and may be different for
  each device (not specified).  The gateway implements an "inactivity timer".
  The default recommended duration of this timer is 12h.  This value is mainly
  driven by application requirements and may be changed.

Class A and classB&C devices do not manage retransmissions and timers in the same way.

#### Class A devices

Class A devices can only receive in an RX slot following the transmission of an
uplink.  Therefore there cannot be a concept of "retransmission timer" for a
gateway talking to classA devices for downlink fragmentation.

The device replies with an ACK fragment to every single fragment received from
the gateway (because the window size is 1).  Following the reception of a FCN=0
fragment (fragment that is not the last fragment of the packet or ACK-request),
the device MUST transmit the ACK fragment until it receives the fragment of the
next window. The device shall transmit up to MAX_ACK_REQUESTS ACK fragments
before aborting. The device should transmit those ACK as soon as possible while
taking into consideration eventual local radio regulation on duty-cycle, to
progress the fragmentation session as quickly as possible. The ACK bitmap is 1
bit long and is always 1.

Following the reception of a FCN=1 fragment (the last fragment of a datagram)
and if the MIC is correct, the device shall transmit the ACK with the  ‚ÄúMIC
is correct‚Äù indicator bit set. This message might be lost therefore the
gateway may request a retransmission of this ACK in the next downlink. The
device SHALL keep this ACK message in memory until it receives a downlink
from the gateway different from an ACK-request indicating that the gateway
has received the ACK message.

Following the reception of a FCN=1 fragment (the last fragment of a datagram)
and if the MIC is NOT correct, the device shall transmit a receiver-ABORT
fragment. The device SHALL keep this ABORT message in memory until it
receives a downlink from the gateway different from an ACK-request indicating
that the gateway has received the ABORT message.  The fragmentation receiver
(device) does not implement retransmission timer and inactivity timer.

The fragmentation sender (the gateway) implements an
inactivity timer with default duration 12 hours. Once a fragmentation session
is started, if the gateway has not received any ACK or receiver-ABORT message
12 hours after the last message from the device was received, the gateway may
flush the fragmentation context.  For devices with very low transmission rates
(example 1 packet a day in normal operation) , that duration may be extended,
but this is application specific.


#### Class B or C devices

Class B&C devices can receive in scheduled RX slots or in RX slots following
the transmission of an uplink.  The device replies with an ACK fragment to
every single fragment received from the gateway (because the window size is 1).
Following the reception of a FCN=0 fragment (fragment that is not the last
fragment of the packet or ACK-request), the device MUST always transmit the
corresponding ACK fragment even if that fragment has already been received. The
ACK bitmap is 1 bit long and is always 1.  If the gateway receives this ACK, it
proceeds to send the next window fragment If the retransmission timer elapses
and the gateway has not received the ACK of the current window it retransmits
the last fragment. The gateway tries retransmitting up to MAX_ACK_REQUESTS
times before aborting.

Following the reception of a FCN=1 fragment (the last fragment of a datagram)
and if the MIC is correct, the device shall transmit the ACK with the ‚ÄúMIC is
correct‚Äù indicator bit set.  If the gateway receives this ACK, the current
fragmentation session has succeeded and its context can be cleared.

If the retransmission timer elapses and the gateway has not received the all-1
ACK it retransmits the last fragment with the payload (not an ACK-request
without payload). The gateway tries retransmitting up to MAX_ACK_REQUESTS times
before aborting.

The device SHALL keep the all-1 ACK message in memory until it receives a
downlink from the gateway different from the last (FCN=1) fragment indicating
that the gateway has received the ACK message.  Following the reception of a
FCN=1 fragment (the last fragment of a datagram) and if the MIC is NOT correct,
  the device shall transmit a receiver-ABORT fragment.  The retransmission
timer is used by the gateway (the sender), the optimal value is very much
application specific but here are some recommended default values.  For classB
devices, this timer trigger is a function of the periodicity of the classB ping
slots. The recommended value is equal to 3 times the classB ping slot
periodicity. For classC devices which are nearly constantly
receiving, the recommended value is 30 seconds. This means that the device
shall try to transmit the ACK within 30 seconds  of the reception of each
fragment.  The inactivity timer is implemented by the device to flush the
context in-case it receives nothing from the gateway over an extended period of
time. The recommended value is  12 hours for both classB&C devices.
