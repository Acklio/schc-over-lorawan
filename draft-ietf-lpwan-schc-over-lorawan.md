--- abstract

The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) specification describes generic
header compression and fragmentation techniques for Low Power Wide Area
Networks (LPWAN) technologies. SCHC is a generic mechanism designed for great
flexibility so that it can be adapted for any of the LPWAN technologies.

This document specifies a profile of RFC8724 to use SCHC in LoRaWAN networks,
and provides elements such as efficient parameterization and modes of
operation.

# Introduction {#Introduction}

SCHC specification [RFC8724] describes
generic header compression and fragmentation techniques that can be used on all
LPWAN technologies defined in
{{RFC8376}}. Even though those technologies share a great
number of common features like star-oriented topologies, network architecture,
devices with mostly quite predictable communications, etc; they do have some
slight differences with respect to payload sizes, reactiveness, etc.

SCHC provides a generic framework that enables those devices to communicate on
IP networks. However, for efficient performance, some parameters
and modes of operation need to be set appropriately for each of the LPWAN
technologies.

This document describes the parameters and modes of operation when
SCHC is used over LoRaWAN networks.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

This section defines the terminology and acronyms used in this document. For
all other definitions, please look up the SCHC specification
[RFC8724].

- DevEUI: an IEEE EUI-64 identifier used to identify the device during the
  procedure while joining the network (Join Procedure). It is assigned by the
  manufacturer or the device owner and provisioned on the Network Gateway.
- DevAddr: a 32-bit non-unique identifier assigned to a device either:

  - Statically: by the device manufacturer in *Activation by Personalization*
    mode.
  - Dynamically: after a Join Procedure by the Network Gateway in *Over The
    Air Activation* mode.

- Downlink: LoRaWAN term for a frame transmitted by the network and
  received by the device.
- FRMPayload: Application data in a LoRaWAN frame.
- OUI: Organisation Unique Identifier. IEEE assigned prefix for EUI.
- RCS: Reassembly Check Sequence. Used to verify the integrity of the
  fragmentation-reassembly process.
- SCHC gateway: It corresponds to the LoRaWAN Application Server. It manages
  translation between IPv6 network and the Network Gateway (LoRaWAN Network
  Server).
- Tile: Piece of a fragmented packet as described in [RFC8724] section 8.2.2.1
- Uplink: LoRaWAN term for a frame transmitted by the device and received
  by the network.

# Static Context Header Compression Overview

This section contains a short overview of SCHC. For a detailed description,
refer to the full specification [RFC8724].

It defines:

1. Compression mechanisms to avoid transporting information known by both
   sender and receiver over the air. Known information is part of the
   "context". This component is called SCHC Compressor/Decompressor (SCHC C/D).
2. Fragmentation mechanisms to allow SCHC Packet transportation on small, and
   potentially variable, MTU. This component is called SCHC Fragmentation/Reassembly
   (SCHC F/R).

Context exchange or pre-provisioning is out of scope of this document.

{: #Fig-archi title='Architecture'}

{{Fig-archi}} represents the architecture for compression/decompression, it is
based on {{RFC8376}} terminology. The device is sending applications flows
using IPv6 or IPv6/UDP protocols. These flows might be compressed by a Static
Context Header Compression Compressor/Decompressor (SCHC C/D) to reduce headers
size and fragmented by the SCHC Fragmentation/Reassembly (SCHC F/R).
The resulting information is sent on a layer two
(L2) frame to an LPWAN Radio Gateway (RGW) that forwards the frame to a Network
Gateway (NGW). The NGW sends the data to a SCHC F/R for reassembly, if
required, then to SCHC C/D for decompression. The SCHC C/D shares the same rules with the
device. The SCHC C/D and F/R can be located on the Network Gateway (NGW) or in
another place as long as a communication is established between the NGW and the SCHC
F/R, then SCHC F/R and C/D. The SCHC C/D and F/R in the device and the SCHC gateway MUST
share the same set of rules. After decompression, the packet can be sent on the Internet to
one or several LPWAN Application Servers (App).

The SCHC C/D and F/R process is bidirectional, so the same principles can
be applied to the other direction.

In a LoRaWAN network, the RGW is called a Gateway, the NGW is Network Server,
and the SCHC C/D and F/R are an Application Server. It can be provided by
the Network Gateway or any third party software. {{Fig-archi}} can be mapped in
LoRaWAN terminology to:

#LoRaWAN Architecture

An overview of LoRaWAN {{lora-alliance-spec}} protocol and architecture is
described in {{RFC8376}}. The mapping between the LPWAN
architecture entities as described in [RFC8724]
and the ones in {{lora-alliance-spec}} is as follows:

   o Devices are LoRaWAN End Devices (e.g. sensors,
   actuators, etc.).  There can be a very high density of devices per
   radio gateway (LoRaWAN gateway). This entity maps to the LoRaWAN end-device.

   o The Radio Gateway (RGW), which is the endpoint of the constrained
   link. This entity maps to the LoRaWAN Gateway.

   o The Network Gateway (NGW) is the interconnection node between the
   Radio Gateway and the SCHC gateway (LoRaWAN Application server). This
   entity maps to the LoRaWAN Network Server.

   o SCHC C/D and F/R are handled by LoRaWAN Application Server; ie the LoRaWAN
   application server will do the SCHC C/D and F/R.

   o The LPWAN-AAA Server is the LoRaWAN Join Server. Its role is to manage and
   deliver security keys in a secure way, so that the devices root key is never exposed.

{: #Fig-LPWANarchi title='LPWAN Architecture'}

*Note*: {{Fig-LPWANarchi}} terms are from LoRaWAN, with {{RFC8376}} terminology in brackets.

SCHC Compressor/Decompressor (SCHC C/D) and SCHC Fragmentation/Reassembly (SCHC F/R)
are performed on the LoRaWAN end-device and the Application Server (called
SCHC gateway). While the point-to-point link between the device and the
Application Server constitutes a single IP hop, the ultimate end-point of the
IP communication may be an Internet node beyond the Application Server.
In other words, the LoRaWAN Application Server (SCHC gateway) acts as the
first hop IP router for the device. The Application Server and Network
Server may be co-located, which effectively turns the Network/Application
Server into the first hop IP router.


## Device classes (A, B, C) and interactions

The LoRaWAN MAC layer supports 3 classes of devices named A, B and C.  All
devices implement the Class A, some devices may implement Class B or
Class C. Class B and Class C are mutually exclusive.

* Class A: The Class A is the simplest class of devices. The device is
  allowed to transmit at any time, randomly selecting a communication channel.
  The Network Gateway may reply with a downlink in one of the 2 receive windows
  immediately following the uplinks. Therefore, the Network Gateway cannot initiate a
  downlink, it has to wait for the next uplink from the device to get a
  downlink opportunity. The Class A is the lowest power consumption class.
* Class B: Class B devices implement all the functionalities of Class A
  devices, but also schedule periodic listen windows. Therefore, opposed to the
  Class A devices, Class B devices can receive downlinks that are initiated by the
  Network Gateway and not following an uplink. There is a trade-off between the
  periodicity of those scheduled Class B listen windows and the power
  consumption of the device: if the periodicity is high downlinks from the NGW
  will be sent faster, but the device wakes up more often: it will have higher
  power consumption.
* Class C: Class C devices implement all the functionalities of Class A
  devices, but keep their receiver open whenever they are not transmitting.
  Class C devices can receive downlinks at any time at the expense of a higher
  power consumption. Battery-powered devices can only operate in Class C for a
  limited amount of time (for example for a firmware upgrade over-the-air).
  Most of the Class C devices are grid powered (for example Smart Plugs).

## Device addressing

LoRaWAN end-devices use a 32-bit network address (devAddr) to communicate with
the Network Gateway over-the-air, this address might not be unique in a LoRaWAN
network; devices using the same devAddr are distinguished by the Network
Gateway based on the cryptographic signature appended to every LoRaWAN frame.

To communicate with the SCHC gateway, the Network Gateway MUST identify the
devices by a unique 64-bit device identifier called the DevEUI.

The DevEUI is assigned to the device during the manufacturing process by the
device's manufacturer. It is built like an Ethernet MAC address by
concatenating the manufacturer's IEEE OUI field with a vendor unique number.
e.g.: 24-bit OUI is concatenated with a 40-bit serial number.
The Network Gateway translates the devAddr into a DevEUI in the uplink
direction and reciprocally on the downlink direction.

## General Frame Types

LoRaWAN implements the possibility to send confirmed or unconfirmed frames:

* Confirmed frame:
  The sender asks the receiver to acknowledge the frame.
* Unconfirmed frame:
  The sender does not ask the receiver to acknowledge the frame.

As SCHC defines its own acknowledgment mechanisms, SCHC does not require to use
LoRaWAN Confirmed frames.

## LoRaWAN MAC Frames

In addition to regular data frames, LoRaWAN implements JoinRequest and JoinAccept
frame types, which are used by a device to join a network:

* JoinRequest:
  This frame is used by a device to join a network. It contains the device's
  unique identifier DevEUI and a random nonce that will be used for session key
  derivation.
* JoinAccept:
  To on-board a device, the Network Gateway responds to the JoinRequest
  issued by a device with a JoinAccept frame. That frame is
  encrypted with the device's AppKey and contains (amongst other fields)
  the network's major settings and a random nonce used to derive the session
  keys.
* Data:
  MAC and application data. Application data are protected with AES-128
  encryption, MAC related data are AES-128 encrypted with another key.

## LoRaWAN FPort

The LoRaWAN MAC layer features a frame port field in all frames. This field
(FPort) is 8 bits long and the values from 1 to 223 can be used. It allows
LoRaWAN networks and applications to identify data.

## LoRaWAN empty frame {#lorawan-empty-frame}

A LoRaWAN empty frame is a LoRaWAN frame without FPort (cf {{lorawan-schc-payload}})
and FRMPayload.

## Unicast and multicast technology

LoRaWAN technology supports unicast downlinks, but also multicast: a packet
sent over LoRaWAN radio link can be received by several devices.  It is
useful to address many devices with same content, either a large binary
file (firmware upgrade), or same command (e.g: lighting control).
As IPv6 is also a multicast technology this feature can be used to address a
group of devices.

_Note 1_: IPv6 multicast addresses must be defined as per [RFC4291].  LoRaWAN
multicast group definition in a Network Gateway and the relation between those
groups and IPv6 groupID are out of scope of this document.

_Note 2_: LoRa Alliance defined {{lora-alliance-remote-multicast-set}} as
the RECOMMENDED way to setup multicast groups on devices and create a synchronized
reception window.

# SCHC-over-LoRaWAN

## LoRaWAN FPort and RuleID {#lorawan-schc-payload}

The FPort field is part of the SCHC Message, as shown in
{{Fig-lorawan-schc-payload}}. The SCHC C/D and the SCHC F/R SHALL concatenate
the FPort field with the LoRaWAN payload to recompose the SCHC Message.

~~~~

| FPort | LoRaWAN payload  |
+ ------------------------ +
|       SCHC packet        |

~~~~
{: #Fig-lorawan-schc-payload title='SCHC Message in LoRaWAN'}

A fragmented datagram with application payload transferred from device to
Network Gateway, is called uplink fragmented datagram. It uses an FPort for data uplink
and its associated SCHC control downlinks, named FPortUp in this document. The
other way, a fragmented datagram with application payload transferred from
Network Gateway to device, is called downlink fragmented datagram. It uses another
FPort for data downlink and its associated SCHC control uplinks, named FPortDown
in this document.

All RuleID can use arbitrary values inside the FPort range allowed by LoRaWAN
specification and MUST be shared by the device and SCHC gateway prior to
the communication with the selected rule.
The uplink and downlink fragmentation FPorts MUST be different.

## Rule ID management  {#rule-id-management}

RuleID MUST be 8 bits, encoded in the LoRaWAN FPort as described in
{{lorawan-schc-payload}}. LoRaWAN supports up to 223 application FPorts in
the range \[1;223\] as defined in section 4.3.2 of {{lora-alliance-spec}}, it implies
that RuleID MSB SHOULD be inside this range. An application can send non SCHC
traffic by using FPort values different from the ones used for SCHC.

In order to improve interoperability, RECOMMENDED fragmentation RuleID values are:

* RuleID = 20 (8-bit) for uplink fragmentation, named FPortUp.
* RuleID = 21 (8-bit) for downlink fragmentation, named FPortDown.
* RuleID = 22 (8-bit) for which SCHC compression was not possible (i.e., no matching
compression Rule was found), as described in {{RFC8724}} section 6.

FPortUp value MUST be different from FPortDown.
The remaining RuleIDs are available for compression. RuleIDs are shared between
uplink and downlink sessions.  A RuleID not in the set(s) of FPortUp or FPortDown
means that the fragmentation is not used, thus, on reception, the SCHC Message
MUST be sent to the SCHC C/D layer.

The only uplink frames using the FPortDown port are the fragmentation SCHC
control messages of a downlink fragmented datagram (for example, SCHC ACKs).
Similarly, the only downlink frames using the FPortUp port are the
fragmentation SCHC control messages of an uplink fragmented datagram.

An application can have multiple fragmented datagrams between a device and one
or several SCHC gateways.  A set of FPort values is REQUIRED for each SCHC gateway
instance the device is required to communicate with.  The application can use
additional uplinks or downlink fragmented parameters but SHALL implement at
least the parameters defined in this document.

The mechanism for context distribution across devices and gateways is
outside the scope of this document.

## Interface IDentifier (IID) computation {#IID}

In order to mitigate the risks described in [rfc8064] and [rfc8065], IID MUST be
created regarding the following algorithm:

1. key = LoRaWAN AppSKey
2. cmac = aes128_cmac(key, DevEUI)
3. IID = cmac[0..7]

aes128_cmac algorithm is described in [rfc4493]. It has been chosen as it is
already used by devices for LoRaWAN protocol.

As AppSKey is renewed each time a device joins or rejoins a LoRaWAN network,
the IID will change over time; this mitigates privacy, location tracking and
correlation over time risks. Join periodicity is defined at the application
level.  

Address scan risk is mitigated thanks to AES-128, which provides enough entropy
bits of the IID.

Using this algorithm will also ensure that there is no correlation between the
hardware identifier (IEEE-64 DevEUI) and the IID, so an attacker cannot use
manufacturer OUI to target devices.

Example with:

* DevEUI: 0x1122334455667788
* appSKey: 0x00AABBCCDDEEFF00AABBCCDDEEFFAABB

~~~~
1. key: 0x00AABBCCDDEEFF00AABBCCDDEEFFAABB
2. cmac: 0xBA59F4B196C6C3432D9383C145AD412A
3. IID: 0xBA59F4B196C6C343
~~~~
{: #Fig-iid-computation-example title='Example of IID computation.'}

There is a small probability of IID collision in a LoRaWAN network. If this occurs,
the IID can be changed by rekeying the device at L2 level (ie: trigger a LoRaWAN
join).
The way the device is rekeyed is out of scope of this document and left to the
implementation.

## Padding

All padding bits MUST be 0.

## Decompression {#Decomp}

SCHC C/D MUST concatenate FPort and LoRaWAN payload to retrieve the SCHC Packet
as per {{lorawan-schc-payload}}.

RuleIDs matching FPortUp and FPortDown are reserved for SCHC Fragmentation.

## Fragmentation {#Frag}

The L2 Word Size used by LoRaWAN is 1 byte (8 bits).
The SCHC fragmentation over LoRaWAN uses the ACK-on-Error mode for uplink
fragmentation and Ack-Always mode for downlink fragmentation. A LoRaWAN
device cannot support simultaneous interleaved fragmented datagrams in
the same direction (uplink or downlink).

The fragmentation parameters are different for uplink and downlink
fragmented datagrams and are successively described in the next sections.

### DTag

[RFC8724] section 8.2.4 describes the possibility to interleave several
fragmented SCHC datagrams for the same RuleID. This is not used in SCHC over
LoRaWAN profile. A device cannot interleave several fragmented SCHC datagrams
on the same FPort.  This field is not used and its size is 0.

Note: The device can still have several parallel fragmented datagrams with
more than one SCHC gateway thanks to distinct sets of FPorts, cf {{rule-id-management}}.

### Uplink fragmentation: From device to SCHC gateway

In this case, the device is the fragment transmitter, and the SCHC gateway
the fragment receiver. A single fragmentation rule is defined.
SCHC F/R MUST concatenate FPort and LoRaWAN payload to retrieve the SCHC
Packet, as per {{lorawan-schc-payload}}.

* SCHC header size is two bytes (the FPort byte + 1 additional byte).
* RuleID: 8 bits stored in LoRaWAN FPort.
* SCHC fragmentation reliability mode: `ACK-on-Error`.
* DTag: Size is 0 bit, not used.
* FCN: The FCN field is encoded on N = 6 bits, so WINDOW_SIZE = 63 tiles
  are allowed in a window.
* Window index: encoded on W = 2 bits. So 4 windows are available.
* RCS: Use recommended calculation algorithm in [RFC8724].
* MAX_ACK_REQUESTS: 8.
* Tile: size is 10 bytes.
* Retransmission timer: Set by the implementation depending on the application
  requirements.
* Inactivity timer: The SCHC gateway implements an "inactivity timer". The
  default RECOMMENDED duration of this timer is 12 hours; this value is mainly
  driven by application requirements and MAY be changed by the application.
* Penultimate tile MUST be equal to the regular size.
* Last tile: it can be carried in a Regular SCHC Fragment, alone in an All-1 SCHC
  Fragment or with any of these two methods. Implementation must ensure that:
  * The sender MUST ascertain that the receiver will not receive
    the last tile through both a Regular SCHC Fragment and an All-1 SCHC
    Fragment during the same session.
  * If the last tile is in All-1 SCHC message: current L2 MTU MUST be big enough to fit
    the All-1 header and the last tile.

With this set of parameters, the SCHC fragment header is 16 bits,
including FPort; payload overhead will be 8 bits as FPort is already a part of
LoRaWAN payload. MTU is: _4 windows * 63 tiles * 10 bytes per tile = 2520 bytes_

For battery powered devices, it is RECOMMENDED to use the ACK mechanism at the
end of each window instead of waiting until the end of all windows:

* the SCHC receiver SHOULD send a SCHC ACK after every window even if there is no
  missing tile.
* the SCHC sender SHOULD wait for the SCHC ACK from the SCHC receiver before sending
tiles from the next window. If the SCHC ACK is not received, it SHOULD send a SCHC
ACK REQ up to MAX_ACK_REQUESTS times, as described previously.

For non-battery powered devices, the SCHC receiver MAY also choose to send a SCHC
ACK only at the end of all windows. This will reduce downlink load on the LoRaWAN
network, by reducing the number of downlinks.

SCHC implementations MUST be compatible with both behaviors, and this selection is
part of the rule context.

### Downlink fragmentation: From SCHC gateway to device

In this case, the device is the fragmentation receiver, and the SCHC gateway the
fragmentation transmitter. The following fields are common to all devices.
SCHC F/R MUST concatenate FPort and LoRaWAN payload to retrieve the SCHC
Packet as described in {{lorawan-schc-payload}}.

* SCHC fragmentation reliability mode:
  * Unicast downlinks: ACK-Always.
  * Multicast downlinks: No-ACK, reliability has to be ensured by the upper
    layer. This feature is OPTIONAL and may not be implemented by SCHC gateway.
* RuleID: 8 bits stored in LoRaWAN FPort.
* Window index (unicast only): encoded on W=1 bit, as per [RFC8724].
* DTag: Size is 0 bit, not used.
* FCN: The FCN field is encoded on N=1 bit, so WINDOW_SIZE = 1 tile.
* RCS: Use recommended calculation algorithm in [RFC8724].
* MAX_ACK_REQUESTS: 8.
* Retransmission timer:  See {{downlink-retransmission-timer}}.
* Inactivity timer: The default RECOMMENDED duration of this timer is 12 hours;
  this value is mainly driven by application requirements and MAY be changed by
  the application.

As only 1 tile is used, its size can change for each downlink, and will be
the currently available MTU.

Class A devices can only receive during an RX slot, following the transmission of an
uplink.  Therefore the SCHC gateway cannot initiate communication (e.g., start a new SCHC
session). In order to create a downlink opportunity it is RECOMMENDED for
Class A devices to send an uplink every 24 hours when no SCHC session is
started, this is application specific and can be disabled. The RECOMMENDED uplink
is a LoRaWAN empty frame as defined {{lorawan-empty-frame}}.
As this uplink is to open an RX window, any LoRaWAN uplink frame from the device
MAY reset this counter.

_Note_: The Fpending bit included in LoRaWAN protocol SHOULD NOT be used for
SCHC-over-LoRaWAN protocol. It might be set by the Network Gateway for other
purposes but not SCHC needs.

{: #Fig-fragmentation-downlink-header-abort title='Receiver-Abort packet (following an All-1 SCHC Fragment with incorrect RCS).'}

#### Downlink retransmission timer {#downlink-retransmission-timer}

Class A and Class B or Class C devices do not manage retransmissions and timers
the same way.

##### Class A devices

Class A devices can only receive in an RX slot following the transmission of an
uplink.

The SCHC gateway implements an inactivity timer with a RECOMMENDED duration
of 36 hours.  For devices with very low transmission rates (example 1 packet a
day in normal operation), that duration may be extended: it is application
specific.

RETRANSMISSION_TIMER is application specific and its RECOMMENDED value is
INACTIVITY_TIMER/(MAX_ACK_REQUESTS + 1).

**SCHC All-0 (FCN=0)**
All fragments but the last have an FCN=0 (because window size is 1).  Following
it, the device MUST transmit the SCHC ACK message. It MUST transmit up to
MAX_ACK_REQUESTS SCHC ACK messages before aborting.  In order to progress the
fragmented datagram, the SCHC layer should immediately queue for transmission
those SCHC ACK if no SCHC downlink have been received during RX1 and RX2 window.
LoRaWAN layer will respect the applicable local spectrum regulation.

_Note_: The ACK bitmap is 1 bit long and is always 1.

**SCHC All-1 (FCN=1)**
SCHC All-1 is the last fragment of a datagram, the corresponding SCHC ACK
message might be lost; therefore the SCHC gateway MUST request a retransmission
of this ACK when the retransmission timer expires.  To open a downlink
opportunity the device MUST transmit an uplink every
RETRANSMISSION_TIMER/(MAX_ACK_REQUESTS * SCHC_ACK_REQ_DN_OPPORTUNITY).
The format of this uplink is application specific.  It is RECOMMENDED for a
device to send an empty frame (see {{lorawan-empty-frame}}) but it is application
specific and will be used by the NGW to transmit a potential SCHC ACK REQ.  
SCHC_ACK_REQ_DN_OPPORTUNITY is application specific and its recommended value
is 2. It MUST be greater than 1. This allows to open a downlink opportunity to
any downlink with higher priority than the SCHC ACK REQ message.

_Note_: The device MUST keep this SCHC ACK message in memory until it receives
a downlink SCHC Fragmentation Message (with FPort == FPortDown) that is not a SCHC ACK REQ: it indicates that
the SCHC gateway has received the SCHC ACK message.

#### Class B or Class C devices

Class B devices can receive in scheduled RX slots or in RX slots following the
transmission of an uplink. Class C devices are almost in constant reception.

RECOMMENDED retransmission timer value:

* Class B: 3 times the ping slot periodicity.
* Class C: 30 seconds.

The RECOMMENDED inactivity timer value is 12 hours for both Class B and Class
C devices.

## SCHC Fragment Format

### All-0 SCHC fragment

**Uplink fragmentation (Ack-On-Error)**:

All-0 is distinguishable from a SCHC ACK REQ as [RFC8724] states *This condition
is also met if the SCHC Fragment Header is a multiple of L2 Words*; this
condition met: SCHC header is 2 bytes.

**Downlink fragmentation (Ack-always)**:

As per [RFC8724] the SCHC All-1 MUST contain the last tile, implementation must
ensure that SCHC All-0 message Payload will be at least the size of an L2 Word.

### All-1 SCHC fragment

All-1 is distinguishable from a SCHC Sender-Abort as [RFC8724] states *This
condition is met if the RCS is present and is at least the size of an L2 Word*;
this condition met: RCS is 4 bytes.

### Delay after each LoRaWAN frame to respect local regulation

This profile does not define a delay to be added after each LoRaWAN frame, local
regulation compliance is expected to be enforced by LoRaWAN stack.

# Security Considerations

This document is only providing parameters that are expected to be best
suited for LoRaWAN networks for [RFC8724]. IID
security is discussed in {{IID}}. As such, this document does not contribute to
any new security issues beyond those already identified in
[RFC8724].
Moreover, SCHC data (LoRaWAN payload) are protected at the LoRaWAN level by an AES-128
encryption with a session key shared by the device and the SCHC gateway. These session keys are renewed at each
LoRaWAN session (ie: each join or rejoin to the LoRaWAN network)

# Examples

In following examples "applicative payload" refers to the IPv6 payload sent by the
application to the SCHC layer.

## Uplink - Compression example - No fragmentation
This example represents an applicative payload going through SCHC over LoRaWAN,
no fragmentation required

An applicative payload of 78 bytes is passed to SCHC compression layer. Rule 1
is used by SCHC C/D layer, allowing to compress it to 40 bytes and 5 bits: 1 byte
RuleID, 21 bits residue + 37 bytes payload.

The current LoRaWAN MTU is 51 bytes, although 2 bytes FOpts are used by
LoRaWAN protocol: 49 bytes are available for SCHC payload; no need for
fragmentation. The payload will be transmitted through FPort = 1.

## Uplink - Compression and fragmentation example

This example represents an applicative payload going through SCHC, with
fragmentation.

An applicative payload of 478 bytes is passed to SCHC compression layer. Rule 1
is used by SCHC C/D layer,  allowing to compress it to 282 bytes and 5 bits: 1 byte
RuleID, 21 bits residue + 279 bytes payload.

The current LoRaWAN MTU is 11 bytes, 0 bytes FOpts are used by LoRaWAN
protocol: 11 bytes are available for SCHC payload + 1 byte FPort field.
SCHC header is 2 bytes (including FPort) so 1 tile is sent in first
fragment.

Next transmission MTU is 11 bytes, although 2 bytes FOpts are used by
LoRaWAN protocol: 9 bytes are available for SCHC payload + 1 byte FPort
field, a tile does not fit inside so LoRaWAN stack will send only FOpts.

Next transmission MTU is 242 bytes, 4 bytes FOpts. 23 tiles are transmitted:

{: #Fig-example-uplink-fragmentation-lorawan-packet-2 title='Uplink example: LoRaWAN packet 2'}

Next transmission MTU is 242 bytes, no FOpts. All 5 remaining tiles are
transmitted, the last tile is only 2 bytes + 5 bits. Padding is added for
the remaining 3 bits.

## Downlink

An applicative payload of 443 bytes is passed to SCHC compression layer. Rule 1
is used by SCHC C/D layer, allowing to compress it to 130 bytes and 5 bits: 1 byte
